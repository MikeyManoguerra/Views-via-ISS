# Views-Via-ISS

This app cobbles together several public API's to display The International Space Station's Current Location, and also serves a LandSat 8 image of this location, if the ISS is over land.  The app is built with jQuery, and is deployed with webpack.

There is a secret form when the .png of the Landsat 8 is clicked.

Improved 'you are here' image for map view, that switches to an astronaut on form submission, (spacewalk).
